# SlingHealthIOSApp
Sling Health DSC Project


Clone the project and open the white xcworkspace file (NOT xcodeproj).

You will need [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)

Run it on the iPhone 11 (it's constraints have not been set for all iPhone sizes yet).

If the project does not build, you may have to delete the PodFile and run `pod install` in the terminal in the project's directory.
